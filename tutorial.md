# Tutorial

### 1. Set up MOA

First of all, we must download and then install a Java IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). I use Eclipse for the purpose of this tutorial.
Once the IDE of choice is set up, we have to download the MOA framework from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Waikato/moa), then import it into your IDE as a Maven project. For that click on `File >> Import... >> Maven >> Existing Maven Project`
