# Drift Detection Methods
You find the implementations of my drift detection methods for MOA framework in this folder.
* **Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDM)**: The method uses a sliding window and [Hoeffding's inequality](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2282952?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) for detecting concept drifts in evolving environments. This work was presented at ECML-PKDD 2016, and published in the proceedings. You will find the paper at: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46227-1_7
* **Stacking Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDMS)**: This method stacks multiple sliding windows, of different sizes, on top of each other for detecting heterogeneous concept drifts, i.e. abrupt or gradual ones, in a stream. My paper for this method is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02457
* **McDiarmid Drift Detection Methods (MDDMs)**: Three drift detection methods based on [McDiarmid's inequality](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/academic_staff/colin_mcdiarmid/?a=4113), namely MDDM-A (for Arithmetic scheme), MDDM-G (for Geometric scheme), and MDDM-E (for Euler scheme), are recently developed and introduced for faster concept drift detection compared to Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDM) and other state-of-the-art methods. You will find the arXiv version of my paper at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02030
